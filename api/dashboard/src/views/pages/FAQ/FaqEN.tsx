      <div>What is Ajuda+?</div>
      <div>
        Ajuda+ is a mobile application developed by mobinteg for Voxpop,
        co-financed by CÃ¢mara Municipal de Lisboa and the European Regional
        Development Fund. It is designed to connect elderly residents of Lisbon
        with a network of volunteers who can assist them with day-to-day
        activities and chores.
      </div>
      <div>What is the objective of Ajuda+?</div>
      <div>
        The main objective of Ajuda+ is to provide a platform that facilitates
        the matching of elderly individuals in Lisbon with volunteers who are
        willing to offer their assistance. The app aims to enhance the quality
        of life for seniors and promote a sense of community and support within
        the city.
      </div>
      <div>How does Ajuda+ work?</div>
      <div>
        Ajuda+ works as a two-sided platform. Elderly individuals living in
        Lisbon can register on the app and specify the type of assistance they
        require. Volunteers can also register and provide information about the
        types of services they are willing to offer, their action radius and
        availability (times and days of the week). The app&apos;s algorithm then
        matches the requests of the elderly with the available volunteers,
        ensuring a suitable match.
      </div>
      <div>What kind of assistance can be requested through Ajuda+?</div>
      <div>
        The app allows elderly users to request assistance with various
        day-to-day activities and chores. This can include tasks such as grocery
        shopping, transportation to medical appointments, companionship, light
        household chores, and other non-medical support.
      </div>
      <div>Who are the volunteers in Ajuda+?</div>
      <div>
        Volunteers on Ajuda+ are individuals who have registered and expressed
        their willingness to help elderly residents of Lisbon. They come from
        various backgrounds and age groups, all united in their desire to make a
        positive impact in the lives of the elderly community.
      </div>
      <div>How are the volunteers screened and selected?</div>
      <div>
        Ajuda+ takes the safety and well-being of its users seriously.
        Volunteers are required to go through a registration process, which
        includes providing personal information and undergoing a background
        check. The background check helps to ensure the safety of the elderly
        users and maintain the integrity of the platform.
      </div>
      <div>Is Ajuda+ available for both Android and iOS devices?</div>
      <div>
        Yes, Ajuda+ is available for download on both Google Play Store (for
        Android devices) and Apple App Store (for iOS devices). This allows a
        wide range of users to access and benefit from the services provided by
        the app.
      </div>
      <div>Is there a cost associated with using Ajuda+?</div>
      <div>
        No, Ajuda+ is a free app for both elderly users and volunteers. The aim
        of the project is to foster community support and improve the well-being
        of elderly residents of Lisbon, without any financial burden on the
        users.
      </div>
      <div>
        What if there are no available volunteers to assist with a request?
      </div>
      <div>
        The app&apos;s algorithm will continuously match requests from elderly
        users with the available pool of volunteers. However, in some cases,
        there may be a temporary shortage of volunteers for certain services or
        areas. In such instances, the app will notify the user and keep
        searching for suitable matches.
      </div>
      <div>How can I get support or report an issue with Ajuda+?</div>
      <div>
        If you have any questions, issues, or require support related to Ajuda+,
        you can reach out to the app&apos;s support team through the contact
        information provided within the app. They will be able to assist you and
        address any concerns or technical difficulties you may encounter.
      </div>
      <div>Is Ajuda+ available only in Lisbon?</div>
      <div>
        Yes, Ajuda+ is specifically designed for elderly residents living in
        Lisbon. The project aims to address the specific needs and challenges
        faced by the elderly population in the city.
      </div>
      <div>Can I volunteer through Ajuda+ if I don&apos;t live in Lisbon?</div>
      <div>
        Currently, Ajuda+ is focused on connecting elderly residents of Lisbon
        with local volunteers. However, there may be plans to expand the service
        to other locations in the future. It&apos;s recommended to stay updated
        with the app&apos;s official communication channels for any
        announcements regarding expansion.
